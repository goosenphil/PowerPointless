An automatic <strong>PowerPoint to video converter</strong>, just click and go!
</p>



Place the program in the same folder as the power point files you want to convert, then go make tea while it takes care of turning them all into videos for you. Supports both pptx and ppsx presentations. (This is the only software which can convert ppsx files, not even PowerPoint can)
